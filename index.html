            <p>When my grandfather bought it in the sixties it had an old pipe organ inside. He took on their restoration in what my mother called a 'mid-life crisis'.</p>
            <p>But my great grandfather is a piano tuner and musician who collects and restores [old vintage period antique] pianos and organs, and specializes in pipe organs.</p>
            <p>My grandfather restored the chapel and the pipe organ to their original splendor.</p>
            <p>He says the organ is as much a part of the church as the church is a part of the organ.</p>
            <p>Though, a lot of the restoration work came from local artisans and was able to be completed through the generous contributions of friends of the project.</p>
