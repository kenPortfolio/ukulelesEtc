            <h2>UkulelesEtc</h2>
<p>UkulelesEtc is a family business run out of an old stone chapel on the outskirts of [location], near St. [name] University.</p>
<p>At UkulelesEtc we make the highest-quality ukuleles for the most discerning of customers.</p>
<p>At UkulelesEtc you can also buy new and used musical instruments, music supplies, sheet music, and more.</p>
<h2>The Chapel Workshop</h2>
<p>The Chapel Workshop is in the basement of the chapel building.</p>
<p>It is the foundation (literally and figuratively) of the family business.</p>
<p>It was started by my grandfather, Bert the Builder, and is where we still restore and repair pianos and organs today.</p>
<p>The Chapel Workshop is now a division of UkulelesEtc and is also where we make our high-quality ukuleles.</p>
<p>Please see the UkulelesEtc website for more information about piano and organ tuning, and other repair and restoration work.</p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>The building, originally the Claybourg Chapel, was built in the early 1900s and is made from granite that was cut from a quarry in Appleton.</p>
<p>The chapel was deconsictated in 1944 after being damaged in an earthquake.</p>
<p>It was restored by my grandfather, Bert the Builder, in the 1960s. The chapel and the grounds are now a designated heritage site.</p>
<p>A lot of the chapel's restoration work came from local artisans. The restoration of the chapel was completed through the generous contributions of friends of the project.</p>
<h2>Bert the Builder</h2>
<p>Just as his father was, my grandfather, Bert the Builder, is a piano tuner and musician. Bert also collects and restores antique pianos and organs, and as anyone who knows him will tell you, has a special place in his heart for pipe organs.</p>
<p>When he bought the chapel in the sixties there was an old pipe organ inside and he dedicated himself to restoring both the chapel and the organ to their original splendor.</p>
<p>Even today he says that the organ is as much a part of the church, as the church is an extension of the organ.</p>
<h2>Heritage and Craftsmanship</h2>
<p>At UkuleleEtc we pride ourselves on heritage and craftsmanship and believe in the value of teaching and history.</p>
<p>Educational tours of the chapel, the grounds and the workshop are avialble.</p>
<p>Best of all, the chapel, the organ and organists are available for events and occassions of all types. Please see our bookings page for more information.</p>
<h2>Young Buck the Entrepeneur</h2>
<p>I'm Young Buck the Entrepeneur!</p>
<p>I have been helping my grandfather repair and restore pianos and organs for many years/since I was 'yay high' and am an apprentice piano tuner.</p>
<p>Starting UkulelesEtc is my way to bring the family business into the digital age and leave Bert more time to focus on his projects.</p>
<p>Be sure to check-out our website where you can buy new and used musical instruments, music supplies, sheet music, and more.</p>
