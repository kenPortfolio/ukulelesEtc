        <h1>Steve:</h1>
        <p>Here is my submission for Assignment #3. It is for a fictional company called UkulelesEtc. My written content is for the landing page. Included are the persona, web outline, and website.</p>
        <p>UkulelesEtc is run by a young entrepreneur, aprentice piano tuner and aspiring luthier. It is a music store that does mostly online sales.</p>          
        <p>The new business is piggybacking on an older family business that included piano and organ tuning, repairs and restorations. These services are still available to a limited extent.</p>            
        <p>It is run out of a heritage building that can be booked for events and is available for educational tours.</p>

            <p>UkulelesEtc is a family business run out of an old stone chapel on the outskirts of Smithville, near St.
                Parson's University.</p>
            <p>At UkulelesEtc we make the highest-quality ukuleles for the most discerning of customers.</p>
            <p>At UkulelesEtc you can buy new and used musical instruments, music supplies, sheet music, and more.
            </p>
            <h2>The Chapel Workshop</h2>
            <p>The Chapel Workshop is in the basement of the chapel building. It is the foundation (literally and figuratively) of UkulelesEtc.</p>
            <p>The Chapel Workshop was started by my grandfather, Bert the Builder, and is where we still restore and repair pianos and
                organs today. It is now a division of UkulelesEtc and is also where we make our high-quality ukuleles.
            </p>
            <p>Please see Repairs & Restorations on the UkulelesEtc website for more information about piano and organ tuning, and other repair
                and restoration work.</p>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The building, originally the Claybourg Chapel, was built in the early 1900s and is made from granite that
                was cut from a quarry in Appleton.</p>
            <p>The chapel was deconsictated in 1944 after being damaged in an earthquake. It was restored by my grandfather, Bert the Builder, in the 1960s. The chapel and the grounds are now a designated heritage site.</p>
            <p>A lot of the chapel's restoration work came from local artisans. The restoration of the chapel was
                completed through the generous contributions of friends of the project.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>My grandfather, Bert the Builder, is a piano tuner and musician. Bert also
                collects and restores antique pianos and organs, and as anyone who knows him will tell you, has a
                special place in his heart for pipe organs.</p>
            <p>When he bought the chapel in the sixties there was an old pipe organ inside and he dedicated himself to
                restoring both the chapel and the organ to their original splendor.</p>
            <p>Even today he says that the organ is as much a part of the church, as the church is a part of the
                organ.</p>
            <h2>Heritage and Craftsmanship</h2>
            <p>At UkulelesEtc we pride ourselves on heritage and craftsmanship and believe in the value of teaching and
                history.</p>
            <p>Educational tours of the chapel, the grounds and the workshop are avialble. Please see Tours on the UkulelesEtc website for more information about educational tours.</p>
            <p>Best of all, the chapel, the organ and organists are available for events and occassions of all types.
                Please see our bookings page for more information.</p>
            <h2>Young Buck the Entrepeneur</h2>
            <p>I'm Young Buck the Entrepeneur!</p>
            <p>I have been helping my grandfather repair and restore pianos and organs since I was 'yay
                high'. I am also a luthier and apprentice piano tuner.</p>
